    <img src="http://images.all-free-download.com/images/graphiclarge/splashed_colours_grunge_vector_241290.jpg" width=300px></img>
    <p> In the following I will be talking about how to make your html file have cool background colors. I will tell you how in steps.</p>
    <ol>    
        <li>First write down &lt;style&gt; </li>
        <li>Then press enter and type body {<br/><br/>} </li>
        <li> write inbetween the brackets background-color: green; but instead of green write down any color you want </li>
        <li> then look at your page there is the color you wanted! </li>
        </ol>
        <p> What that does is make you background colorfull. Without it youbackground will be very plain and boring. I did it that way because  </p>
    <h1> Next is me teaching you how to make lists </h1>
    <img src="http://www.impactlists.com.au/ImpactLists/media/images/lists-image.png" width=300px></img>
        <p> I am now going to make a list to help teach you how to make a list.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> First type &lt;ol&gt;</li>
            <li> Then press enter and type &lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt;</li>
            <li> In between them trpe what you want to say </li>
            <li> Keep repeating from step two and it will look like the list your readinf right now.</li>
            <li> If you want to make a list that is not numbered put &lt;ul&gt; instead of &lt;ol&gt;</li>
        </ol>
            <p>What typing those things out does is that it makes a list for you. If you did not do what I said than nothing will show up because you did not do any commands. But if you did a different command it will not look like a list will just look like words going down. </p>
    <h1> I am now going to teach you how to make a paragraph in html file.</h1>
    <img src="https://wb713.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/img1661.png?w=640" width=300px></img>
        <ol>
            <li> All you have to do is type &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; and write whatever you want in between &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;. </li>
            <li> All done </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By doing what I said to do, you are able to make parapgraphs or just time what you want to say in normal font. Without this, your words will not show up or if you try to do an other command the words will not be in normal font.I put it that way because p is short for paragraph.</p>
    <h1> I am now going to tell you how to have a image show up on html file. </h1>
    <img src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/128458/pexels-photo-128458.jpeg" width=300px></img>
        <ol>
            <li> First you have to do is put &lt;img src=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</li>
            <li> Next you find a picture on the web </li>
            <li> press view image and copy its url</li>
            <li> paste the url between the "" after putidth=300px </li>
            <li> now your are done! Enjoy the picture you chose.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>What coping what I did does is it makes a picture show up on your page. Without the picture your page will be boring and it might be a little harder to understand what you are trying to explain or talk about.</p>
        <h1> How I did the About Me Page </h1>
        <p> The way I made the about me page took alot of commands,in the following I will list the commands I used and explain why I used those commands.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;style&gt; then type body {<br/><br/>}  in between the brakets write the color you want</li> 
            <p>I did that to make my background look exciting instead o a normal and dull color</p>
            <li> Next I did &lt;h1&gt; </li>
            <p> I did that to make the letters I type bold and to make it a title</p>
            <li> I also did&lt;img src=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt; paste picture url in between the ""</li>
            <p>I did that to make the website more exciting. </p>
            <li> Next I did &lt;p&gt;</li>
            <p>I did that so I can wtrite sentances or paragraphs in normal font.</p>
            <li> for for the next one I did lists to do that you do &lt;ol&gt; than put &lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt; after you press enter in between them you put what yo want to make another one just do &lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt; again </li>
            <p> I did thatb so I could list things about me and what I have learned </p>
        </ul>
