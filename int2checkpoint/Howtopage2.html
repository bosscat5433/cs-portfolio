    <h1> How to make a happy face that follows your mouse and leaves a trail </h1>

    <h2> In the following I will be talking about my project like what I made and how I made it like that.</h2>
    
    <p> What I made is a big happy face that follows your curser. When the face follows the curser it leaves a trail of the happy faces behind. When the mosue is at a certain part of the box it changes color. Plus I have a background that randomizes everytime you refresh. The project works well overall and does what it is supposed to do. </p>
    
    <h3>Codes I used to make my masterpiece</h3>
    
    <img src= "https://specs.adfox.ru/help/images/AdobeEdgeHTML3.png" width=500px></img>
    
    <p> The first code I used was the forloop. That looks like for (var i = 0; i &lt; width; i+= 30){}<br/> that makes it so it repeats until it is more or equal to 30. This helps make the backgroun d change into different patterns each time.<p>
        
    <p>The next command I used was the if condition. The way I wrote it was if(random(30)&lt;20). What it is used for is if the mouse is at a certain part of the square it changes the happy face's color.</p>
    
    <p>The next command I did was fill(29, 96, 209); This command changed a specific object to a color that was chosen.</p>
    
    <p>Another command I did was ellipse: 50, 20, 20, 40 this made a circle and the 4 numbers after it shapes the height and size and where it is on the page.</p>
    
    <p>The command draw = function() {} madeit so the happy face left a trail of its duplicates.</p>
    
    <p> The last but not least command was var eyeSize = 40;. This command defined a veriable so I could put a in a function and that a would be a  40.</p>
    
    <h3> The choices I had to make and how I went about making them.</h3>

    <ol> 
    
    <li> What I should make. </li>
    
     <p> I thought about a lesson I did in khan academy that gave me the idea to make a happy face that follows then mouse.</p>
    
    <li> How I should make my happy face look like</li>
    
   <p>I used elipses to make my happy face</p>
    
    <li> What background I should use</li>
    
    <p> I used a for loop to make it randomly generate red and blue circles with black dots to mak a different background every time</p>
    
    <li> If I should have my happy face leave a trail or not.</li>
    
    <p> I used the draw function soit keeps drawing the face where ever it goes to make a trail.</p>
    
    </ol>
    
     <h3> What I haven learned and will never forget </h3>
     
     <img src = "https://pics.me.me/what-we-learn-with-pleasure-we-never-forget-alfred-mercier-5431418.png">
     
     <p> I learned how to do the ellipse. I will make sure to remember how to do it becuaseit makes circles on the program. With one shape you can make many other shapes or pictures. To do ellipse you type :ellipse like I explained before there are 4differentnumbers after the ellipse command those number make the circle bigger smaller and in what spot it will be.</p>
     
     <h3> More steps I would do to improve my project.</h3>
     
     <p> Some extra steps I would do to improvemy project if I had more timne would be adding more places where the happy face would change colors. Another thing I would add would be making the background have more things that change</p>
